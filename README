NAME
    DBICx::MaterializedPath - (Pre-alpha!) DBIx::Class plugin for
    automatically tracking lineage paths in simple data trees.

VERSION
    0.01_01

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
  METHODS
    ancestors
    get_root
    grandchildren
    node_depth
    root_node
    set_materialized_path
    siblings

  OVERRIDDEN METHODS
    insert
    update

CAVEATS
    If your materialized path column is insufficiently large you're going to
    have problems. A "VARCHAR(255)" is only wide enough to support a tree
    which is 35 nodes deep if the average PK is integers in the millions.
    This might be fine for your usage. Just be aware path tracking is not
    arbitrary, it's limited to the column's width.

TO DO
    Better documents; obviously.
    More tests; what else is new?

    DBIx::Class::Ordered, DBIx::Class.

  WHY NOT DBIx::Class::Ordered?
    There are data sets which have implicit, or even tacit,
    orderingE<mdash>E<rdquo>positionE<ldquo> in DBIx::Class::Ordered
    parlanceE<ndash> in the data already. Published articles, for example,
    will be naturally ordered chronologically. Additional position tracking
    becomes complex and redundant in this kind of case. You can even run
    into cases where both types of ordering are necessary like a collection
    of dictionaries. Each dictionary's terms are ordered alphabetically
    while each term's definitions would be ordered by a position set at
    editorial discretion.
